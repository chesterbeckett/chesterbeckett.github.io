This one's for Cian.

This is probably a very popular/common way to do Buffalo Wings, a firm favourite, dead easy and low prep requirement!

There are probably plenty of variations on this too, but I've gone with the bare minimum, and you can choose to add bits as you need/want.

Now I usually cook the wings on the braai, but the oven will do just as well. For the braai method, you want to offset your coals and cook the wings indirect with the braai covered, you will need high heat for this one to get the wings crispy.

# Ingredients

## For Crispy Wings
- 1 kg Chicken wings
- 2 tbsp Baking powder (NOT Baking Soda)
- 1/2 tsp Salt
- 1/2 tsp Pepper

## Buffalo Wing Sauce
- 120 grams Unsalted Butter
- 180 ml <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/iR3vThY" target="_blank">Frank's Red Hot Sauce</a>
- 1 tbsp Honey
- Salt/Pepper for seasoning

# Steps

## Prepare the wings
1. Pat down the wings with some paper towel to remove excess moisture.
2. Toss the wings in a large bowl with the baking power, salt and pepper. Ensure an even coating on all the wings.
3. Lay out the wings on a baking tray, skin side up, touching is fine but you want to spread them out for even cooks.
4. Allow wings to cool in the fridge for as long as possible. An hour or two if possible.
5. While the wings are cooling, pre-heat the oven* to 180-200 C.
6. Once you are are ready to start cooking, pop the wings into the oven, bottom shelf for around 20mins. Turning them halfway.
7. After 20mins on the bottom, raise them up to the top shelf and turn up the oven to around 220 C. Turn the wings back to skin side up.
8. Cook till golden and crispy, around 10mins.

## Prepare the sauce

You can make the sauce while the wings are cooling or cooking and reheat when the chicken is ready.

> Optional: I like to add an extra kick to mine so I get a fresh Scotch Bonnet (or just half, or less), finely chopped and add to the melted butter, cook for 1 min before adding Frank's.

1. Melt the butter in a sauce pan.
2. Once melted add in the <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/iR3vThY" target="_blank">Frank's Red Hot Sauce</a> and bring up to temp, not boiling.
3. Add the honey.
4. Taste and season as required with salt/pepper to taste.
5. Keep the sauce warm for the tossing.

## Toss and serve

1. Once the wings are done, after about 30mins in the oven, toss the wings in a large mixing bowl together with the buffalo sauce.
2. Ready to serve.
