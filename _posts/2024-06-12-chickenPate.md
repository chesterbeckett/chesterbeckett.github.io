I got this recipe from a good friend. It's a simple recipe that can quite possibly change your views on paté forever. Great for Christmas time!

# Ingredients

The volumes below makes a lot of paté, which i usually do for friends and family. Adjust to your requirements.

- 400grams chicken livers
- 5-6 Sweet onions, such as shallots or similar
- 2 cloves of crushed garlic
- 200grams of butter for the cook, and probably a load more for the finish (step 12)
- Half pack streaky bacon
- 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon thyme (leaves picked from the stalk)
- Teaspoon celery salt
- 3 shots of cream
- A lot of Sherry (Dark preferably)

# Steps

1. Slice/chop the onions up, and soften them in the pan with butter, make sure not to crisp/burn them, you want them soft.
2. While the onions are softening, chop the bacon into small pieces.
3. Once the onions have softened a bit, add in the garlic and bacon.
4. After cooking the bacon for 2-3 minutes add in all the chicken livers, do not cover, to reduce water content.
5. You will want to cook the livers evenly, until they are a little pink still in the middle. Dont over cook them.
6. Add in the thyme and celery salt, you could also season with a bit of black pepper.
7. Once the livers are cooked through, dont over cook, take off the heat and let the pan/contents cool.
8. Once the livers have cooled you blend them, either in a large food processor or stick blender in deep pan/dish.
9. As you blend add in the cream and sherry, taste the mix to check taste, add cream/sherry as preferred. You can add quite a lot of sherry for the sweetness.
10. You want the consistency of the blend to be quite thick, so it pours slow, but is also smooth. Add cream to thicken as required. Balance with sherry.
11. Once the blend and taste is to your preference transfer into small ramekins or dishes to set, dont fill the dish to the top, leave a space of about 0.5cm.
12. Melt butter in low heated pan, and once melted, top up each of the ramekins to the top, and allow to cool. Once cooled, place in the fridge to set further.

Once the butter has solidified the paté is good to go. I usually cover the dishes with cling film before going into the fridge. You can also play with the amounts of butter/cream/sherry to get to your desired taste/consistency.

Enjoy with small toasts or crackers.
