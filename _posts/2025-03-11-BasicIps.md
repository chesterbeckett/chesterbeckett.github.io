On **30 September 2025, Basic SKU public IP addresses will be retired** in Azure. You can continue to use your existing Basic SKU public IP addresses until then, however, you'll no longer be able to create new ones after 31 March 2025.

### Standard SKU public IP addresses offer significant improvements, including:

- Access to a variety of other Azure products, including: Standard Load Balancer, Azure Firewall, and NAT Gateway.
- Security by default. Closed to inbound flows unless allowed by a network security group.
- Zone-redundant and zonal front ends for inbound and outbound traffic.
