On **30 September 2025, Basic SKU public IP addresses will be retired** in Azure. You can continue to use your existing Basic SKU public IP addresses until then, however, you'll no longer be able to create new ones after 31 March 2025.

You can see the official announcement <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/updates?id=upgrade-to-standard-sku-public-ip-addresses-in-azure-by-30-september-2025-basic-sku-will-be-retired" target="_blank">here.</a>

## Required Action

To avoid any potential service disruptions, review <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/details/ip-addresses" target="_blank">pricing</a> and then upgrade to Standard SKU public IP addresses by 30 September 2025.

Microsoft have provided guidance on migration paths for some of the resources using basic public IPs.

### Common Migration Scenarios

| Migration Resource  | Decision Path |
| ------------------- |-------------- |
| Virtual Machine | Use scripts or manually detach and upgrade public IPs. For standalone virtual machines, you can use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-upgrade-vm?tabs=azure-cli" target="_blank">upgrade script</a> or for virtual machines in an availability set use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-upgrade-availability-set">this script</a>. |
| Virtual Machine Scale Sets | <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-networking?tabs=portal1#public-ipv4-per-virtual-machine">Replace basic SKU instance public IP addresses</a> with new standard SKU. |
| Load Balancer (Basic SKU) | New Load Balancer SKU required. Use the upgrade script <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/load-balancer/upgrade-basic-standard-with-powershell">Upgrade Basic Load Balancer to Standard SKU</a> to upgrade to Standard Load Balancer. |
| VPN Gateway (using Basic IPs) | A migration path will be provided in the future. When this migration path is available, we'll update this decision path with migration information and send out a service health alert. For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-vpn-faq#migrating-a-basic-sku-public-ip-address-to-standard-sku">Migrating a basic SKU FAQ</a>. |
| ExpressRoute Gateway (using Basic IPs) | New ExpressRoute Gateway is required. Follow the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/expressroute/gateway-migration">ExpressRoute Gateway migration guidance</a> for upgrading from Basic to Standard SKU. |
| Application Gateway (v1 SKU) | New AppGW SKU required. Use this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/application-gateway/migrate-v1-v2">migration script to migrate from v1 to v2</a>.|


### Standard SKU public IP addresses offer significant improvements, including:

- Access to a variety of other Azure products, including: Standard Load Balancer, Azure Firewall, and NAT Gateway.
- Security by default. Closed to inbound flows unless allowed by a network security group.
- Zone-redundant and zonal front ends for inbound and outbound traffic.

## Virtual Machines

For Basic Public IPs assigned to VMs, there are a few scenarios to consider:

- [VMs with an NSG](#VMs with an NSG)
- VMs behind a load balancer
- VMs without NSGs
- VMs in a VM Scale Set

### VMs with an NSG

https://blog.beckett.life/posts/BasicIps/#stand-alone-vms-with-an-nsg

In order to perform the upgrade, the Public IP Address allocation method should be set to static before being disassociated from the VM. Once disassociated, the Public IP SKU is upgraded to Standard, then the IP is re-associated with the VM.

Because the Public IP allocation is set to 'Static' before detaching from the VM, the IP address won't change during the upgrade process.

Microsoft have provided a script for this scenario, that does all the work for you.

```powershell
Install-Module -Name AzureVMPublicIPUpgrade -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force
```

Module parameters:

- *VMName* [string] Required - This parameter is the name of your VM.
- *ResourceGroupName* [string] Required - This parameter is the resource group for your VM with the Basic Public IPs attached that you want to upgrade.

Examples:

Single VM:
```powershell
Start-VMPublicIPUpgrade -VMName 'myVM' -ResourceGroupName 'myRG'
```
To upgrade all VMs in a resource group, skipping VMs that do not have Network Security Groups:
```powershell
Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName 'myRG' | Start-VMPublicIPUpgrade -skipVMMissingNSG
```

This query returns a list of virtual machine IDs with Basic SKU public IP addresses attached. It uses Powershell to run a Resource Graph query to return the results for you.
```powershell
Search-AzGraph -Query "resources | where type =~ 'microsoft.compute/virtualmachines' | project vmId = tolower(id), vmNics = properties.networkProfile.networkInterfaces | join (resources | where type =~ 'microsoft.network/networkinterfaces' | project nicVMId = tolower(tostring(properties.virtualMachine.id)), allVMNicID = tolower(id), nicIPConfigs = properties.ipConfigurations) on `$left.vmId == `$right.nicVMId | join ( resources | where type =~ 'microsoft.network/publicipaddresses' and isnotnull(properties.ipConfiguration.id) | where sku.name == 'Basic' | project pipId = id, pipSku = sku.name, pipAssociatedNicId = tolower(tostring(split(properties.ipConfiguration.id, '/ipConfigurations/')[0]))) on `$left.allVMNicID == `$right.pipAssociatedNicId | project vmId, pipId, pipSku"
```
