To enhance the overall reliability of Azure Traffic Manager health checks, Microsoft will begin rolling out new health check infrastructure from 4 March to 30 May 2025.

To ensure a smooth transition with no service disruptions, Traffic Manager profiles will be running on both the new infrastructure as well as the current system.

As a result, you may notice an intermittent increase in the number of health probes during health checks for your application endpoints. Once the new infrastructure is fully rolled out, the number of probes will return to normal.

Throughout the rollout, all Azure Traffic Manager features will continue to work normally, and no action is required. If you have application firewall or anomaly detection rules that might be triggered by the increased volume of health probes, we'd recommend adjusting your configuration to accommodate this change.
